> Twitch Offline Replay (TOR) is a project designed to simplify the process of recording streams from Twitch for users who wish to follow specific streamers closely. It offers a seamless way to favoriate streamers of interest, automatically record their streams when they go live, and store the recordings locally for later viewing.

## Features
 - Streamers Selection: Users can select their favorite streamers to follow.
 - Auto Recording: Once a selected streamer goes live, the system automatically starts recording the stream.
 - Customizable Preferences: Users can set quality preferences for each streamer, including options for capturing audio only (smaller files).
 - Skip Streamers: In future updates, users will have the option to skip recording streams from specific streamers if desired.
 - Offline Availability: All recordings are available for playback once the streamer goes offline.
 - Storage Options: Currently, recordings are stored locally, with future plans to offer storage solutions such as Amazon S3 or other blob storage services.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using bun install.
3. Configure your Twitch API credentials.
4. Run the application using bun start (this will be improved in the future).

## Usage

1.  Launch the application.
2.  Sign in with your Twitch account.
3.  Select the streamers you wish to follow.
4.  Set your recording quality preferences.
5.  Enjoy auto-recorded streams from your favorite streamers!

## Future Plans

- Implement the ability for users to skip certain streamers.
- Integrate file storage with something like Amazon S3 or another Blob based storage solution.
- Enhance user interface for better user experience.
- Implement additional features based on user feedback and demand.
